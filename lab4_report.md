# Report for Improvements to Flight Booking Service

### Analysis 

To address some of the problems found in the previous booking app I have added the following improvements. For the issue I had regarding the simplicity and lack there of proper instructions for the user, I have added a few prompts to help advise the user. I have given instructions and sample input to guide the user. There is no delays in the prompts and it the interaction is all rather smooth. 

The application repeats the booking to the user as soon as the form is filled and prompts the user to confirm it is correct. 

I believe this version of the booking service is much more convenient and allows the user to say exactly what they mean with minimal prompts, in the event of a misunderstanding the user can start again and the prompt will give a golden example of what the machine is expecting.
